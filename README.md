# Bounty Bot

## Usage

This bot is created to create bounties to give your discord community an incentive. They can complete bounties in exchange for rewards (provided at your own discretion NOT our discretion). 
There is a premium license which is paid monthly, every 3 months, every 6 months or yearly. You get some features for free but wew chose this model to support the basic costs of the bot and to improve it.
Some of the premium features are: 
- Unlimited concurrent bounties active
- No copyright text on the bottom of embeds
- Faster support
- Early access to new features
- More to come...

There is also the option to [donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DFWYVYABRRJX4) which is entirely up to you and is also to maintain and update the bot.

All money gotten through this project wil go straight to Outcasts as funds to maintain this project AND create new and exciting projects.
